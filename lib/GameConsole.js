/*Game Console

The constructor should accept a single argument
systemName, and set a public variable systemName to the
value of that constructor argument.

The class should have a play method that accepts a single
argument game and return a status message.

game is an object with a single key title with a value that's
a string.

status message should be in the format: 'this system name plays the game object's title'
example: Jupiter Station plays Shynobie
